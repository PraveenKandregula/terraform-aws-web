Infrastructure problem
Problem:
Use Vagrant development environment to setup an environment which does the following:
1. Front-end web proxy (HAproxy or other of your choice). the front-end will do Load balancing for the
backend layer. there are several LB modes, choose one, and familiarise yourself with other options.
Please note it is ok to implement the simplest solution for the purpose of this assignment.
2. Backend servers - at least 2, these could be nginx, apache, whichever you like and feel comfortable.
The back-end servers should be balanced (any method) between them using the front-end proxy.
3. Make sure that the backend servers present a test page which identifies them and can help
understand which is which when content is served. eg. display the hostname.
Guidelines:
1) You have free rein to incorporate any software tools and hardware you need to streamline application
deployment and infrastructure provisioning & configuration as long as they are Free/Libre/Open Source
software (FLOSS). We request that you use Linux.
2) You should use a virtualization solution such as VirtualBox for these environments. We will use
VirtualBox, VMWare or EC2 (your choice) to build your environments.
3) The ability for us to build your environments, in scripts and/or documentation, no binaries.
